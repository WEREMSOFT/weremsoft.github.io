Hi, since twitter becomes a toxic environment, I decided to create my own. Here there is no ads or silly suggestions or inflamatory comments. Hope is better for your mental health.
If you hant to have your own you can <a href="https://github.com/WEREMSOFT/weremsoft.github.io.git" >fork the site</a>. You can still see my <a href="https://x.com/weremsoft">old twitter acctount</a>. Is there for historical purposes.
